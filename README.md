# WireViewer
The App is programmatically created using the UIKit framework, deleted storyboard.
I Tried applying MVVM but in the process changed my opinion. 
On iPhones, the list and detail in separate screens.
The app offers search functionality that filters the character list according to characters whose titles or descriptions contain the query
text
Clicking on an item loading  the detailed view of that character, including the character’s title, and description. 

Note: 
I didn't use Images because most of the characters don't have an image link, and other links just didn’t work.
